        <p class="para">Bred solely to be companions, Shih Tzus are affectionate, happy, outgoing house dogs who love nothing more than to follow their people from room to room. ... They make great family pets who get along with other animals and even children, so long as kids know how to gently handle and play with a small pup.Family Dog

            Combined with their confidence, lack of prey drive, friendly nature, and affectionate demeanor, Shih Tzus are great family dogs. They do not mind being handled by respectful children, enjoy short bouts of play time, and are loyal to their companions.</p>
